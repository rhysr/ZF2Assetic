ZF2Assetic
==========

Assetic module for Zend Framework 2

This module generates in two ways either by creating the asset each time it is requested via the controller or by generating the asset to disc by using a script and then letting the webserver handle it

## Config

all config lives in the zf2_assetic array
``` php

return array(
   'useAssetController' => true, //use controller for asset, false means read from disk, recommend true for dev
   'assetManifestPath' => __DIR__ . '/../data/asset-manifest.json', //path to a json file that maps the assetName to it's path on disk, generated by build script
   'collections' => array(
       //array of all defined asset collections the module will provide

   'base_css' => array(
           'root' => __DIR__ . '/../assets/', //source directory for this collection's assets
           'assets' => array( //list of assets to be compiled into collection
               'css/test.css',
           ),
           'filters' => array(
               'AsseticCssRewriteFilter', //service manager name of assetic filters to apply
           ),
           'options' => array(
               'output' => 'base.css', //public path to collection
           ),
    ),

 )
);
```

## TODO

 - console controller needs tests
 - factories for all the assetic filters
 - params for filter factories e.g. node binary path
